            Hi, I'm Ting with my lovely wife Angelina. I am a software engineer who specializes in creating dynamic and clean web pages. I
            enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to
            work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn
            new languages and development techniques are important to me and the
            success of the organization and I have been loving every minute of
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a family guy, technology enthusiast, and overall a thinker. I
            am skilled in designing, testing, and developing application,
            thoroughly understanding of data structures and algorithms,
            knowledgeable of front-end/back-end development best practices,
            hands-on software troubleshooting experience, and proven track
            record of proper documentation for future maintenance.
